\textcolor{green}{The benchmarks confirm that SHA-256 is unsuitable for password storage due to its extremely fast computation speed. bcrypt and Argon2id exhibit much higher per-hash costs, significantly increasing brute-force resistance. Argon2id additionally consumes memory, providing resistance to parallelized attacks. Overall, algorithm choice alone can substantially improve security for real-world password storage.}
