Research on password hashing has primarily examined the design goals and theoretical properties of modern key-derivation functions. The Password Hashing Competition (PHC) final report provides the most comprehensive comparison of Argon2 against PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt, emphasizing memory-hardness and resistance to parallel attacks rather than practical performance on consumer hardware~\cite{BDK15}. Earlier foundational works introduce PBKDF2~\cite{Kal00}, bcrypt~\cite{PM99}, and scrypt~\cite{Per09}, focusing on security motivations and parameter choices, but offering limited empirical benchmarking across platforms.

More recent studies, such as Li’s cross-platform library evaluation~\cite{Li21}, explore performance differences between operating systems and implementations. Industry recommendations like the OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet~\cite{Fou23} provide parameter guidance but do not quantify runtime cost on typical laptops.
