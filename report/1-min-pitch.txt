Weak password hashing remains one of the biggest causes of credential leaks.
Even today, many systems still rely on outdated or improperly configured hashing algorithms, which makes passwords far easier to brute-force than people expect.

Prior work focuses heavily on theory, but there’s far less clear, practical benchmarking that shows how these algorithms actually behave on real hardware—especially across CPU cost, memory usage, and brute-force resistance.
That gap is what motivated our project.

Our goal was simple:
test modern password hashing algorithms—SHA-256, bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2id—under identical conditions, and measure how they perform in practice.

We built a Python-based benchmarking suite that runs three types of tests:

CPU runtime per hash

Peak memory usage

Simulated brute-force speed

Our results show a clear pattern:

SHA-256 is extremely fast, which makes it great for integrity checks but terrible for password storage because attackers can test millions of guesses per second.

bcrypt slows attackers down significantly but is still mostly CPU-bound.

scrypt and Argon2id introduce memory hardness, which dramatically increases brute-force cost and makes them far safer against GPU or ASIC attacks.

In conclusion, modern systems should avoid fast hashes entirely, and even bcrypt is no longer ideal for high-security applications.
Argon2id is the strongest choice today, especially when configured with high memory and iteration parameters.

Our benchmarking makes this visually clear and provides real, reproducible numbers to guide developers toward safer password storage.
